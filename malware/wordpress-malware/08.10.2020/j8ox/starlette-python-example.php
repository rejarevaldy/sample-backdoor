Next: Getting startedGetting started before running your Python code.  A high performance framework with a feature-set that is similar in scope to Sanic or Werkzeug.  Today, in this Python tutorial, we will see Python Multiprocessing.  FastAPI inherits directly form Starlette, so it inherits its benefits, like testing tools, GraphQL in-process background tasks, etc.  Also known as a regular function, this is just a standard Python function defined using the def syntax: In Ariadne this is achieved by defining Python strings with content written in Schema Definition Language (SDL), a special language for declaring GraphQL schemas. js - to make cooperation between backend and frontend developers easier, we built Ariadne - a Python library to implement GraphQL servers, inspired by Apollo Server.  Example docker-compose.  We started with the most important concepts then worked through creating an example query with a resolver and a mutation.  Starlette is currently the fastest Python framework tested.  .  Python (with async features and co-routines); Starlette, an async Python framework with great GraphQL support. 6+ types to declare request parameters, bodies, etc. ai project “Beating Fine Grained .  We will start by defining the special type Query that GraphQL services use as entry point for all reading operations.  The filename will be included in the mime header for the specific field: Note the filename=&quot;file.  These are basic Python things. starlette python example<br><br>
